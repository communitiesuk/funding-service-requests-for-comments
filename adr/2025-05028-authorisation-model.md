## Overview
As part of the new Funding Service platform — Deliver Grant Funding, for internal users, and Access Grant Funding, for external and end users —  we need a robust and reliable approach to authorisation. 

The platform will serve a number of different users (Funding Service admins, grant teams, other government departments (OGDs), assessors, grant recipients at both pre and post-award, Section 151 Officers). There is an established need for these users to have different levels of permissions within the platform and for certain actions and flows to be restricted to certain roles within the platform, within an organisation or within an individual grant. There is also a need and desire to allow collaborative submissions of data (though audit trails etc. of shared submissions is not in the scope of this ADR), and a likely need for organisations to be able to allocate individuals to specific sections of an application or monitoring data for collaborative submissions of data. This will require an organisation view of users which our current digital services do not have.

As we think about some level of self-service in the future of the platform there is also the desire to allow certain existing users to invite others to the platform, to lessen the onboarding burden within the Funding Service.

This ADR specifically focuses on authorisation, not authentication, and the thinking behind how we want to manage user roles and permissions within the platform.

## What is the current state?

The current user management for applicants is based on a single-user model, which while allowing a user to complete an application, does not have any strong concept of a user’s organisation.

On the Assessment side we are constrained by needing to request from IT a new Security Group and Roles for each grant that we onboard. This means currently putting a fund into assessment will currently always require developer input to configure this element. Whilst we have requested more control over this process from IT, it has not yet been granted  several months since the initial request.

### Delta's model
Delta already has a strong concept of organisations and roles (such as a Section 151 Officer within an organisation), as well as the ability to assign organisations to take part in specific collections.

Key concepts:
* Access Groups - Every dataset and grant has an associated access group, and users can only see and interact with datasets and grants if they are in that access group.
* Roles - Fixed set of roles that determine the types of actions a user can take on the Delta system. Some roles can be self-selected by the user.
* Organisations - A user is a member of one or more Organisations. Organisations themselves can be added and edited by administrators. Each organisation has a list of associated domains. Access to organisations is primarily determined by whether a user's email domain is on that list of domains.

The Delta model is also very self-serve and built on a level of trust:
* Users self-select their roles in a profile management type view
    * Global administrators can assign themselves and other users to Access Groups and Roles; standard users can only assign themselves to certain roles
* Delta knows you are part of a certain Organisation based on email domain
* Users and Organisation owners do not get any email notifications when they or other users select/deselect roles. The only email notifications around roles/permissions are for S151 Officers
* If an organisation has no S151 Officers, then new/existing users can self-select that role. Otherwise, the existing S151 can nominate delegated approvers. This generally isn't self-service and requires some manual intervention
* If a User doesn't have the relevant email domain but are the S151/other key role for that Organisation (eg. a consultancy or senior representative from a different Local Authority) then it's a manual process to add them, check their credentials and legitimacy of the request, all of which is quite time consuming but a necessary audit and due diligence process. 
* If a user has a set role, they have that for all the collections/Access groups that they're a part of or have access to - a role is set for the user, not for the collection/organisation.

## Why should we change?

As established in the overview, the current User Management and Access Control functionality in the existing services limits us from implementing a number of features which are known user needs, such as:

* Allowing users to view or collaborate on data submissions from the same organisation, including at different stages such as between pre and post-award
* Limiting submissions per organisation (for example, enforcing only one submission per Local Authority or organisation)
* From a reporting side, allowing us to track which organisations from an expected list have submitted a monitoring return
* Having a stronger concept of organisations also supports data standards, as organisations can be strongly linked to known identifiers, enabling easier place-based reporting

Being able to implement these would be a significant value-add from the new platform and should allow for further iteration and refinement going forward as the platform and the needs of its users develop. We don't want to build ourselves into a corner where the technological constraints lead to a hard no on implementing new features and functionality.

## How should we address this?

While we would continue to use Entra ID to authenticate internal users and implement/investigate other authentication methods (magic links, federating with Delta’s existing user login, and potentially authenticating through GOV.UK OneLogin), we feel implementing our own Role-Based Access Control for user permissions would enable us to remove the current dependency on IT and have greater granular control over permissions within the platform to meet the user needs outlined above.

While this ADR doesn't focus on authentication, using Entra ID for internal user authentication would allow us to continue to manage one key user group via Microsoft Groups, namely the `FSD_ADMIN` group which is used to identify Funding Service staff who would need admin-level access to the entire platform. This would be captured on login and the relevant role automatically created for users belonging to that group, but we would try to avoid using Microsoft Groups to manage and create other permissions.

### Model

Controlling User Management and Access Control ourselves is not an insignificant task, and one that needs to have a clear model and concept. We also have the added complication that our model would ideally work for external users (ie. grant applicants/recipients) and internal users (grant team members, OGDs, Funding Service admins).

Our database already includes the concept of Users, Grants and Organisations (though as of the time of writing our Organisation model is very light-touch, but will be fleshed out later as we think through reference data and the [Organisation data standard](https://communitiesuk.github.io/funding-service-data-standards/organisation.html)).

Creating a single UserRole table which acts as a join table between these three tables, with nullable `organisation_id` and `grant_id` columns, allows us to have very granular permissions at a full platform level, organisation level or grant level.

It's worth noting that the Organisation data standard linked to above suggest a direct link between User and Organisation, whereas ours would be through the UserRole table. This is fine, as the data standard isn't describing an extact database structure and implementation, but rather an indication that Users should be able to be linked to Organisations somehow and that link being at the discretion of the platform/service implementing the standards.

![Access Control Model](/images/userrole-model.png)

In the example model above, Roles are a set list controlled by an enum which can easily be extended but keeps roles to a known quantity. Having a separate table for Roles was also considered, but initially while our set of Roles are relatively few, a separate table felt slightly over-engineered.  

You then have the ability to define roles and permissions by using the nullable columns:

| Role type | Description | Database row |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Funding Service administrator | Full platform admin priveleges | ADMIN role with no `organisation_id` or `grant_id` |
| MHCLG Organisation admin | An internal user who needs full overview of all MHCLG grants | ADMIN role with no `grant_id` |
| MHCLG Grant team member | An internal Grant Team user who read-only access to a specific grant | MEMBER role with an `organisation_id` and `grant_id` (`organisation_id` potentially optional) |
| External Organisation admin | An external user who needs full overview of that Organisation's applications/monitoring returns | ADMIN role with no `grant_id` |
| Organisation member | A user who needs read-only access to everything attached to an organisation | MEMBER role with no `grant_id` |
| Grant admin | A user who needs top-level priveleges for a specific grant, either internal eg. grant team admin or external eg. someone with oversight of an entire application or monitoring return | ADMIN role with both an `organisation_id` and `grant_id` |
| Organisation S151 Officer | An Organisation's S151 Officer | S151_OFFICER role with an `organisation_id` |
| Grant editor | An internal user who will need to edit Grant details or Grant collection information, or an external user who can edit parts of a grant application or monitoring return | EDITOR role with both an `organisation_id` and `grant_id` |
| Grant Assessor | An internal user assigned to assess individual grant applications or review other submitted data | ASSESSOR role with an `organisation_id` and `grant_id`|

This also allows developers to produce easy, reusable checks for permissions levels and only need to check one table based on the active user's information, and also implement database-level constraints on certain combinations which should not be allowd, eg. a MEMBER should not be possible if `organisation_id` and `grant_id` are `null` or `S151_OFFICER` should only be possible with an `organisation_id` and no `grant_id` ie. they are a S151_OFFICER at an Organisation level.

It's worth noting why MHCLG is defined as a distinct Organisation in the example table above. This is predominantly in the anticipation that OGDs will be using the service at some point, and there will be a need to define permissions at Organisation-level. If the service was remaining MHCLG-only then this wouldn't be necessary. 

The difference in Organisation-level Admins in the table above will come down to which Organisation (or kind of organisation) they're an admin for - if it's an internal organisation such as MHCLG or DfE then the permissions will be centred around Deliver Grant Funding and the set up and management of grants. If it's for external Organisation then the permission-level will focus on the visibility of applications/monitoring returns etc. from that Organisation.

We have identified the need to implement a robust permissions-checking core library alongside this role table so developers aren't having to make and implement micro-decisions around permissions at every point.

For the purposes of the initial MVP, for Deliver Grant Funding (internal facing) we're catering for Funding Service administrators and Grant team members (who will have read-only access to one or more Grants). As with the examples given above, the building blocks are in place to easily extend this.

There are a couple of product decisions which will need to be made:
* how far the concept of 'self-service' goes, ie. can organisation or grant administrators invite other users?
* how visible will the information be? Do we default to locked-down visibility based on explicit permissions (ie. only people explicitly linked with a grant can see that Grant's information) or do we have a more open approach (eg. Organisation admins can see all information attached to that Organisation?), but the above model should allow us to cater for either approach.

### Organisation concept

We would need some concept or ability to associate users with an organisation, eg. based on their email domain, allowing them to self-select, a more manual administrator task etc.

For internal MHCLG users who authenticate with Entra ID (Funding Service administrators, grant team members, some  internal assessors), this will be able to be done programmatically on login. For grant applicants/recipients (including Section 151 Officers) this won't be possible, so following Delta's pattern of using email domains to detect organisation is a sensible starting point. 

There are known edge cases (such as the S151 Officer case outlined above in the Delta section, consultants filling out or submitting monitoring returns on behalf of multiple Local Authorities, or grant recipients who do not have an obvious email domain eg. a community group grant applicant with a gmail email address) which will need to be accounted for. Some of this could be manually done by Funding Service admins within the platform or require some level of requested organisation information on that user's first login, other instances (such as S151 Officers) could be handled by getting them to authenticate via Delta and receiving organisation information back with that authentication request.

Using email domain is a sensible first pass at detecting user organisations without manual intervention, but we will need to users being attached to multiple organisations and the ability to override the detected organisation.

If Organisation becomes a core concept in the views or grants that are visible to a user, we can also think about an approach similar to GOV.UK Notify which has a simple 'switch organisation/service' option in the header.

### Permissions

Some authorisation models map roles to permissions (e.g., "Set up a grant"), whereas the authorisation model proposed here ends at Role. At this early stage, the thinking is that the role itself will dictate the permissions, ie. and Admin can do everything within a platform/organisation/grant, a Member is a read-only member and won't see any action buttons, Assessors and S151 Officers have very specific permissions as well, and the (currently vaguely-named but could be renamed) Editor would have write permissions for the elements that sit within their Organisation or Grant, depending on their role level. Having a distinct list of roles also means they can be hierarchical - an Admin will always have more permissions than an Editor, who will have more permissions than a Member, and this clear hierarchy means we can imply the role above has all the permission of the role below and so won't need to add checks for each and every level.

While the roles we are managing remain relatively low in number we would like to strongly define what these roles can do without the need of a linked permissions table. If this grows to become unwieldy then this is certainly something we can implement into the model, and as mentioned above we have identified the need to implement a robust permissions-checking core library alongside the role table, which should take care of a lot of the low-level authorisation checks.

### Learnings
As mentioned above there are a number of lessons we're taking from other services. With Delta, we're keen to allow authentication via Delta for some key user groups further down the line (including returning relevant user information with the response such as Organisation and Section 151 Officer role), but also learning from their patterns and approach.

Above we've also mentioned GOV.UK Notify - their model of an Organisation (which can have overall administrators), with Services (ie. analogous to our concept of 'Grants') sitting below and users being able to be assigned to one or more Organisations and to one or more Services is something we have tried to embody in our own model as it keeps the concepts simple and easy to parse for developers, designers and users. As an existing pattern used by a large-scale government service this should also mean developers and some users have a level of familiarity with this pattern which will lead to easier adoption of the model in the platform.

## What alternatives are we discarding?

* The current system - we know this is overly restrictive and not fit for the user needs we have, as well as being a very manual process that relies heavily on IT
* The full Delta model (flat permissions and self-serve) - there are a number of patterns we can reuse from Delta's roles and permissions model but we know that even if we move to a more self-serve permissions model later there will be some level of control still needed, so what we end up with will likely be between these two options
* Off the shelf/third-party platform (eg. [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/)) - this was considered but in the end decided it wasn't what we needed for now for a number of reasons:
    * Cognito offers "user pools", for authentication, and "identity pools", for authorisation (but seem to be tied to granting access to AWS resources rather than authorisation within our own system)
    * While we may decide switching to Cognito for authentication in future is worthwhile, for authorisation it doesn't entirely do what we'd need it to do and we'd still need to manage permissions and roles within our own system
    * Building out the Access Control ourselves lets us keep things simple and controlled in the short term to build for MVP with our specific use-cases in mind while also making sure the solution is as future-proof as possible
    * We are currently heavily reliant on Azure for permissions/role-based access as well as authentication, and there are a lot of pain-points with this (having to add people to AD groups etc.), so keeping authentication with AD and then having more in-platform control of the roles and permissions seemed like a sensible approach (and as mentioned above we could then switch to Cognito for authentication if we felt it worthwhile in the future)
This may be something we need to revisit as the complexity grows, but this also meets our team principles of being pragmatic - "right-sizing" solutions and avoiding over-engineering solutions - and keeping things simple and maintainable as much as possible.

## Who will be affected?

This will be a significant change in our how our service operates, so will affect all internal and external users as well as the Funding Service team (eg. developers, onboarding etc.). However, with some users having familiarity with Delta and Notify, this should give them an existing level of familiarity with this approach.

## Who will benefit?

Hopefully everyone - it will be less painful than the current system, give us greater flexibility and control over user management and access control that will allow us to meet our user needs for the platform, and give greater visibility and audit trails across the board.

## What are the key risks to manage or mitigate?

* **Security risks** - though this ventures into authentication rather than authorisation, it's worth raising here that by owning the login page ourselves there is still some security risk that we will have to own, such as risks of exploitation, DOS, SQL injection, MFA authentication vulnerabilities etc. This is something we will have to continue to mitigate against.
* **Role complexity in the codebase** - we preach simplicity and maintainability so we don't want the number of roles to grow and become unwieldy leading to confusing permissions checks within the codebase. Everything needs to be well defined and managed.
* **Organisation reference data** - the question of Organisation reference data (particularly regarding grant recipient organisations such as Local Authorities) is still an open question as to where this will sit and how we will pull it into the platform.
* **Balance of control vs visibility** - particularly as the number of roles grow and we move towards some level of self-service, we'll need to be sure that people don't see data or information they shouldn't but also that user and role management does not become onerous.
